# Project closed: 420 Code can't be used
The 420 code was in a [draft version of the WebDAV standards](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-05#section-10.5).  Some programming languages have this code registered as "Method Failure".  As such, it is unsuitable for use for a different purpose.
# "Policy Violation"
Instead, a version of this will be proposed as a [RFC 9457 registered problem type](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9457.html#registry).  The problem type will provide information on the policy violated, the URL and any bearer token required to assert remediation.
